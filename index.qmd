## **Current Focus**

I am completing my MBA at University Canada West, where I focus on digital transformation, AI in education, and how technology changes the way people learn and work. Alongside my studies, I work as a Research Assistant examining how students perceive AI-generated feedback, fairness, and trust in academic environments.

I also advise professionals and teams on how to work more effectively with information. My recent work includes training on knowledge management, optimizing digital collaboration tools, and helping people integrate AI into their daily workflows. Across all projects, I focus on clarity, structure, and practical improvements that reduce cognitive load.

Before moving into research and consulting, I spent several years in knowledge management within large technology and consulting environments. This experience shapes my interest in helping organizations adopt digital tools in a grounded and human-centered way.
